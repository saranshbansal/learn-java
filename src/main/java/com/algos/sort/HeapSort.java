/**
 * <What is heap?>
 * A heap is a tree with some special properties, so value of
 * node should be greater than or equal to(less than or equal to in case of min
 * heap) children of the node and tree should be complete binary tree.
 * <p>
 * <Binary heaps>
 * Binary heaps are those heaps which can have up to 2 children.
 * <p>
 * <Understanding complete binary tree>
 * Complete binary tree is a binary tree whose leaves are at h or h-1 level where
 * h is height of the tree.
 * <p>
 * Index of left child= 2*(index of its parent)+1
 * Index of right child= 2*(index of its parent)+2
 * <p>
 * <Steps for heap sort>
 * 1. Represent array as complete binary tree.
 * Left child will be at 2*i+1 th location
 * Right child will be at 2*i+2 th location.
 * <p>
 * 2.Build a heap.
 * - All the leaf nodes already satisfy heap property, so we
 * donï¿½t need to heapify them.
 * - Last leaf node will be present at (n-1)th location, so parent of it will
 * be at (n-1)/2 th location, hence (n-1)/2 will be location of last non leaf node.
 * - Iterate over non leaf nodes and heapify the elements.
 * <p>
 * 3. After building a heap, max element will be at root of the heap.
 * We will exchange it with (n-1)th location, so the largest element will be at
 * proper place and remove it from the heap by reducing size of n.
 * <p>
 * 4. When you exchange the largest element, it may disturb max heap property,
 * so you need to again heapify it.
 * <p>
 * 5. Once you do above steps until no elements left in heap, you will get sorted
 * array in the end.
