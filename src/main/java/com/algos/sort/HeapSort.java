/**
 * HEAP SORT - A Beginner's Guide
 *
 * Think of HeapSort like organizing a tournament bracket where the strongest player
 * always rises to the top, then we remove them and repeat until everyone is ranked.
 * The "tournament bracket" is the heap structure, "crowning champions" is extracting the maximum,
 * and "finding your level" is the heapify operation. It's a systematic way to rank everyone from strongest to weakest!
 *
 * === WHAT IS A HEAP? ===
 * A heap is like a family tree where:
 * - Parents are always stronger than their children (in a max heap)
 * - The tree is "complete" - filled from left to right, top to bottom
 * - We can represent this tree using a simple array!
 *
 * Array representation: [50, 30, 40, 10, 20, 35, 25]
 * Tree visualization:
 *         50 (index 0)
 *       /    \
 *     30(1)      40(2)
 *    / \     / \
 *   10(3)  20(4)  35(5)  25(6)
 *
 * === ARRAY TO TREE MAGIC FORMULAS ===
 * For any element at position i:
 * - Left child is at position: 2*i + 1
 * - Right child is at position: 2*i + 2
 * - Parent is at position: (i-1)/2 (floor division)
 *
 * === HOW HEAPSORT WORKS (4 SIMPLE STEPS) ===
 *
 * STEP 1: BUILD THE HEAP
 * - Start with a messy array
 * - Rearrange it so parents are bigger than children
 * - Work backwards from the last parent to the root
 *
 * STEP 2: EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM
 * - The root (position 0) is always the largest
 * - Swap it with the last element
 * - Now the largest is in its final sorted position!
 *
 * STEP 3: SHRINK THE HEAP
 * - Reduce heap size by 1 (ignore the sorted element)
 * - The new root might be out of place
 *
 * STEP 4: FIX THE HEAP (HEAPIFY)
 * - Let the new root "sink down" to its proper position
 * - Compare with children and swap with the larger child
 * - Repeat until heap property is restored
 *
 * REPEAT STEPS 2-4 until the heap is empty!
 *
 * === WHY IS THIS EFFICIENT? ===
 * - Time Complexity: O(n log n) - always consistent performance
 * - Space Complexity: O(1) - sorts in place, no extra memory needed
 * - Unlike QuickSort, it never has worst-case O(nÂ²) performance
 *
 * === REAL WORLD ANALOGY ===
 * Imagine you're organizing a company hierarchy:
 * 1. Make sure every manager is more qualified than their subordinates
 * 2. Promote the CEO (most qualified) to the "alumni" list
 * 3. Pick a new CEO candidate and let them find their proper level
 * 4. Repeat until everyone is properly ranked
