/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Observer Pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Observer design
 * pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want
 * to get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object
 * that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object
 * that is being watched is called Subject.
 * <p>
 * According to GoF, observer design pattern intent is;
 * <p>
 * Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
 * changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
 * <p>
 * Example: This pattern can be found in almost every GUI environment. When
 * buttons, text, and other fields are placed in applications the application
 * typically registers as a listener for those controls. When a user triggers an
 * event, such as clicking a button, the control iterates through its registered
 * observers and sends a notification to each.
 * <p>
 * For our observer pattern java program example, we would implement a simple
 * topic and observers can register to this topic. Whenever any new message will
 * be posted to the topic, all the registers observers will be notified and they
 * can consume the message.
 * PS: For simplicity forget about synchronization.

 * The method implementation to register and unregister an observer is very
 * simple, the extra method is postMessage() that will be used by client
 * application to post String message to the feed. Notice the boolean variable
 * to keep track of the change in the state of feed and used in notifying
 * observers. This variable is required so that if there is no update and
 * somebody calls notifyObservers() method, it doesn�t send false notifications
 * to the observers.
 *
 * Also notice the use of synchronization in notifyObservers() method to make
 * sure the notification is sent only to the observers registered before the
 * message is published to the feed.
